# HelpMeRead - Government Correspondence Translation Solution

## Initial Problem Statement
Elderly Singaporeans who are not proficient in English face significant challenges in understanding government correspondence. This leads to feelings of disempowerment, frustration, and dependence on others. There is a need for a simple, accessible solution that enables elderly individuals to understand letters from government agencies in their preferred language or dialect with minimal effort, such as scanning a QR code or taking a photo.

## Research Findings

### Demographics
- As of 2024, elderly individuals make up **19.9%** of Singapore's population.
- In 2023, **53%** of those aged 65 and above could not read in English.

### Interview Insights
Research conducted with six elderly Singaporeans aged **68-86** (across both genders) revealed that language barriers result in:
- Inaction
- Reliance on family members
- Feelings of helplessness

### Voice of the Elderly

| Role | Age/Gender | Quote |
|------|------------|-------|
| Housewife | 70F | "I struggle with English and fear making mistakes. I just wish there was a simple way to understand what the government is telling me without constantly relying on my family." |
| Retail worker (part-time) | 69F | "I don't understand English well, especially when the government asks me to go online. I don't know how to do it." |
| Taxi Driver (part-time) | 70M | "English is a hurdle. Studying was a luxury back then. I don’t know if a letter is important until I understand what it says." |

### User Preferences

| Role | Preferences | Role | Preferences | Role | Preferences |
|------|-------------|------|-------------|------|-------------|
| Interviewee 1 | Prefers audio: "Hands-free, don't need to focus so much on small text. More straightforward. Sometimes hard to read." | Interviewee 2 | Prefers intuitive design: "No learning curve required. Prefer to read, but if there is audio, it’s a bonus. Chinese is good enough." | Interviewee 3 | Prefers dialect: "Only read-aloud in dialect is good as that is my main language." |
| Interviewee 4 | Prefers simplicity: "Must be easy to use. Text and speech (dialect is a plus) to help understanding." | Interviewee 5 | Prefers simplicity and audio: "Yes, must be simple and easy. Read out. Chinese is sufficient for me." | Interviewee 6 | Prefers accessibility: "Must be easy to use with big font. Need to be able to translate to Chinese." |
